	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the utility of linguistic features for detecting the sentiment of Twitter messages.  We evaluate the usefulness of existing lexical resources as well as features that capture information about the informal and creative language used in microblogging.  We take a supervied approach to the problem, but leverage existing hashtags in the Twitter data for building training data.},
